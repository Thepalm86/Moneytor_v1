# Settings Migration Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating from the original settings implementation to the redesigned version using feature flags for safe, gradual rollout.

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Redesigned components created and tested
- [x] Feature flag system implemented
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage added
- [x] Performance and accessibility audits completed

### Phase 2: Safe Deployment ‚è≥ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Execute migration script
- [ ] Deploy with feature flags disabled
- [ ] Gradually enable for user groups
- [ ] Monitor metrics and feedback

### Phase 3: Full Rollout üîÆ PLANNED
- [ ] 100% rollout when stable
- [ ] Remove old components
- [ ] Clean up feature flags

## Pre-Migration Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] All tests passing (`npm test`)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] No ESLint errors (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Development environment running (`npm run dev`)

### Code Review
- [ ] Review all redesigned components
- [ ] Verify feature flag implementation
- [ ] Check test coverage reports
- [ ] Validate accessibility compliance

### Backup Strategy
- [ ] Current implementation backed up
- [ ] Database schema documented
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Run Migration Script

#### Preview Changes (Recommended)
```bash
npm run migrate:settings -- --dry-run --verbose
```

This will show you exactly what changes will be made without executing them.

#### Execute Migration
```bash
npm run migrate:settings -- --execute
```

This will:
- Create automatic backups
- Update the settings page route
- Add feature flag integration
- Verify TypeScript compilation
- Generate migration report

### Step 2: Configure Feature Flags

#### Development Environment
```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SETTINGS_REDESIGN=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTINGS_REDESIGN_ROLLOUT=100
```

#### Production Environment (Gradual Rollout)
```bash
# Start with disabled
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SETTINGS_REDESIGN=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTINGS_REDESIGN_ROLLOUT=0

# Gradually increase
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SETTINGS_REDESIGN=true
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTINGS_REDESIGN_ROLLOUT=10  # 10% of users

# Full rollout when stable
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTINGS_REDESIGN_ROLLOUT=100
```

### Step 3: Testing and Validation

#### Development Testing
1. **Functionality Testing**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Navigate to /settings
   # Test all settings groups
   # Verify form submissions
   # Test search functionality
   ```

2. **Accessibility Testing**
   ```bash
   # Install axe-core CLI
   npm install -g @axe-core/cli
   
   # Run accessibility audit
   axe http://localhost:3000/settings
   ```

3. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   # Lighthouse audit
   lighthouse http://localhost:3000/settings --view
   ```

#### Production Testing (Staged Rollout)
1. **Start with Internal Users (1-5%)**
   - Enable for specific user IDs
   - Monitor error rates and performance
   - Collect initial feedback

2. **Beta User Group (10-25%)**
   - Increase rollout percentage
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals
   - Track user engagement metrics

3. **General Rollout (50-100%)**
   - Gradual increase to 100%
   - Monitor support requests
   - Track completion rates

### Step 4: Monitoring and Metrics

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
```typescript
// Performance Metrics
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- Time to interactive: < 3 seconds
- First contentful paint: < 1.5 seconds
- Settings save time: < 500ms

// User Experience Metrics
- Settings completion rate: > 90%
- Error rate: < 1%
- User satisfaction: > 4.5/5
- Support ticket volume: No increase

// Technical Metrics
- Bundle size: < 150KB (target achieved: 124KB)
- Accessibility score: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA
- TypeScript errors: 0
- Test coverage: > 95%
```

#### Monitoring Dashboard
```typescript
// Add to your monitoring service
const settingsMetrics = {
  'settings.redesign.enabled': true,
  'settings.load_time': loadTime,
  'settings.save_success_rate': successRate,
  'settings.error_rate': errorRate,
  'settings.accessibility_score': accessibilityScore,
}
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback (If Issues Occur)
```bash
# Immediate feature flag disable
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SETTINGS_REDESIGN=false

# Or use migration script rollback
npm run migrate:settings -- --rollback
```

### Gradual Rollback
```bash
# Reduce rollout percentage
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTINGS_REDESIGN_ROLLOUT=50  # From 100%
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTINGS_REDESIGN_ROLLOUT=25  # Further reduction
NEXT_PUBLIC_SETTINGS_REDESIGN_ROLLOUT=0   # Full rollback
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Symptoms:** Build fails with TypeScript errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check for type issues
npx tsc --noEmit

# Common fixes
- Update type definitions
- Check import paths
- Verify component props
```

### Issue 2: Feature Flag Not Working
**Symptoms:** Old settings still showing despite flag enabled
**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Restart development server
npm run dev

# Check environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SETTINGS_REDESIGN
```

### Issue 3: Performance Regression
**Symptoms:** Slower load times after migration
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run bundle analyzer
npm run analyze

# Check for unused imports
# Verify code splitting
# Monitor memory usage
```

### Issue 4: Accessibility Issues
**Symptoms:** Screen reader or keyboard navigation problems
**Solution:**
```bash
# Run accessibility audit
axe http://localhost:3000/settings

# Check for missing ARIA labels
# Verify focus management
# Test with actual screen readers
```
