## Phase Completion Protocol

**⚠️ IMPORTANT WORKFLOW:**
1. At the end of each phase, I will mark it as **COMPLETED** in this document
2. I will then **REQUEST PERMISSION** from you before proceeding to the next phase
3. This ensures quality gates and allows for feedback/adjustments between phases
4. No phase will begin without explicit approval

## Current Issues Analysis

**Structure Problems:**
- **Over-engineered component hierarchy** - 11 separate components for settings
- **Complex state management** - Multiple hooks with redundant patterns
- **Visual overload** - Heavy use of gradients, icons, and decorative elements
- **Poor information hierarchy** - Important settings buried in visual noise
- **Inconsistent patterns** - Mixed card/section layouts causing confusion

**UX/UI Problems:**
- **Cognitive overload** - Too many visual elements competing for attention
- **Complex navigation** - Sidebar + tabs + cards create decision paralysis
- **Poor mobile experience** - Heavy desktop-focused layouts
- **Accessibility issues** - Over-reliance on color/icons for meaning

## Strategic Redesign Approach

**Design Principles:**
1. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show essential settings first, advanced options on demand
2. **Scannable Hierarchy** - Clear information structure using typography, not colors
3. **Task-Oriented Design** - Group settings by user goals, not technical categories  
4. **Mobile-First** - Clean, responsive design that works everywhere
5. **Accessibility First** - Proper contrast, semantic markup, keyboard navigation

## Simplified Page Structure

**New Component Architecture:**
```typescript
/settings/
├── page.tsx (route handler - unchanged)
├── settings-page-redesigned.tsx (new main orchestrator)
├── components/
│   ├── settings-header.tsx (clean header with search)
│   ├── settings-group.tsx (replaces complex sections)
│   ├── settings-item.tsx (individual setting component)
│   ├── quick-actions.tsx (common tasks shortcut)
│   └── settings-search.tsx (search/filter functionality)
```

**Consolidated Settings Groups:**
1. **Account** (Profile + Security combined)
2. **Preferences** (Currency + Display + Notifications)
3. **Data & Privacy** (Export + Security + Privacy)
